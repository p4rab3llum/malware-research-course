## Why do I need a virtual machine?

Some of you may be wondering, "Why do we need to make some kind of virtual machine and spend resources (disk, RAM, CPU) on it at all, if we can analyze everything on the main device?"

The answer is: yes, it is certainly possible to perform *most* of the actions suggested in this course on the main device, but it is **extremely undesirable**.

Why? It's very simple - the human factor, which can play at the most inopportune moment. If the system hangs for a second, an accidental extra click on the mouse - and there, your family photos are securely encrypted (and of course you don't have the decryption key) or deleted.

All in all, you shouldn't walk around the edge without a strong need for it.

> Of course, when my laptop wouldn't let me pull more than one virtual machine, I did my analysis on the main device. But, with all that, I was fully aware of the dangers, took responsibility for it and observed the necessary precautions.

In this regard, please remember one important thing that in case of any mishap in the analysis of malware on the main machine, you perform these actions at your own risk.

Okay, now let's get to the point.

## Configuring the virtual environment

There are 2 options here:

1. Installing an off-the-shelf virtual machine
2. Self-configuration

Which one of these ways to choose is up to you.

### Installing an off-the-shelf virtual machine

This method is for those who have a powerful PC and lots of free hard disk space.

Instructions

1. Download [image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BMJ_Sh-5QgAoDzz4RR6SXTwvMQK-MMVd/view?usp=share_link) of virtual machine
2. Import it into VirtualBox.
3. Check the operation of the virtual machine.

If everything is OK - you are great! You can relax until the next session.

### Self-tuning

If the first point does not suit you (for whatever reason), then you have to configure everything yourself.

For this we will need:

1. Windows x64 ISO - 1 pc.
2. [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy/releases) - 2 items (x32/x64)
3. [DiE](https://github.com/horsicq/DIE-engine/releases) - 1 pc.
4. [IDA Pro](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gCjwh-3cYq4qOJL5oz0uo-L_CZTSXzUO/view?usp=share_link) - 1 pc. 

Further everything is standard: create a virtual machine (I advise to allocate at least 4 GB of RAM to it), put the programs from 2, 3 and 4 points on it and check the work of each of them (just in case).

## Conclusion

As you can see, everything so far is not so difficult.

See you at the next class!
